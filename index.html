							<p>If you are attending from out of town, there are a number of hotels in the area. We can recommend the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspfe-fairfield-inn-and-suites-minneapolis-eden-prairie/">Fairfield Inn in Eden Prairie</a>, family members have stayed there before and had a good experience and it's fairly inexpensive. The <a href="http://minneapolisedenprairie.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html">Hyatt Place</a>, next door to the Fairfield Inn, is also nice.</p>
